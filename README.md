# ncspotlyrics

A python script to print out lyrics of songs played on [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot) in time with the lyrics if possible. The lyrics are sourced from [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net).

TODO:
- Make sure all edge cases are accounted for and handle the errors accordingly
- Make an ncurses version so it looks better
- Rewrite it in rust so it becomes ***blazing fast***
